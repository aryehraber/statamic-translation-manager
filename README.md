## Instructions
For instructions and documentation, please refer to [documentation.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) or to the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/marketplace/addons/translation-manager).

## Description
This addon lets you export Pages, Globals, Collections and Taxonomies to all available languages or to the one you choose. 
The exported file can then be modified by a translation agency or yourself, and imported again to apply the changes to your site.

## Supported field types
Most field types are now supported out of the box. If you're missing something feel free to open an issue or PR. I'd be happy to take a look at it!
